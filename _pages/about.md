Welcome! My name is Jordan Satler and I am an evolutionary biologist. I am a Postdoctoral Researcher co-advised by [Dr. Tracy Heath](http://phyloworks.org/) and [Dr. John Nason](https://www.eeob.iastate.edu/faculty/nason/) in the Ecology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology department at Iowa State University. I am from San Diego, California, where I earned a Bachelor’s degree at San Diego State University. In the senior year of my undergraduate studies, I took a course in Terrestrial Arthropod Biology taught by [Dr. Marshal Hedin](https://marshalhedinlab.com/)---this course had a profound effect on my life. Following a year off after graduation, I entered the Master’s program at San Diego State University in Evolutionary Biology, being fortunate enough to have Marshal as my advisor. For my thesis, I worked on the systematics and evolution of the trapdoor spider genus *Aliatypus*, focusing on phylogenetic relationships, biogeographic patterns, and species limits. After earning a Master’s degree in 2011, I started my PhD with [Dr. Bryan Carstens](https://carstenslab.osu.edu/) at Louisiana State University, and then moved with Bryan a year later to THE Ohio State University. For my dissertation, I investigated the community phylogeography of eukaryotes---with a focus on the arthropods---in the *Sarracenia alata* carnivorous pitcher plant system. I spent 5 excellent years in the Carstens lab, and grew a lot as a scientist during this time under Bryan’s tutelage. For my postdoc research, I am studying the coevolution of Neotropical figs and fig wasps. In particular, I use genome-scale data, statistical methods, and computational tools to infer the coevolutionary processes important for maintaining this obligate mutualism, and the processes governing species boundaries and reproductive isolation versus hybridization and introgression within these lineages.
