I am from San Diego, California, where I earned a Bachelor’s degree at San Diego State University. In the senior year of my undergraduate studies, I took a course in Terrestrial Arthropod Biology taught by [Dr. Marshal Hedin](https://marshalhedinlab.com/)---this course had a profound effect on my life. Following a year off after graduation, I entered the Master’s program at San Diego State in Evolutionary Biology, being fortunate enough to have Marshal as my advisor. For my thesis, I worked on the systematics and evolution of the trapdoor spider genus *Aliatypus*, focusing on phylogenetic relationships, biogeographic patterns, and species limits.

After earning a Master’s degree in 2011, I started my PhD with [Dr. Bryan Carstens](https://carstenslab.osu.edu/) at Louisiana State University, and then moved with Bryan a year later to The Ohio State University. For my dissertation, I investigated the community phylogeography of the *Sarracenia alata* carnivorous pitcher plant system and associated eukaryotes, with a focus on the arthropods. I spent five excellent years working with Bryan, and grew a lot as a scientist and as a person during my time in the Carstens lab.

For my postdoctoral research, I worked with [Dr. Tracy Heath](http://phyloworks.org/) and [Dr. John Nason](https://www.eeob.iastate.edu/faculty/nason/) in the Ecology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology department at Iowa State University studying the coevolution of Neotropical figs and fig wasps. In particular, I was interested in using genome-scale data, statistical methods, and computational tools to infer the coevolutionary processes important for maintaining this obligate mutualism. I also worked on understanding the processes governing species boundaries, reproductive isolation, and the importance of hybridization and introgression within these interacting lineages.

I recently moved back to The Ohio State University for a postdoctoral research position in the Evolution, Ecology, and Organismal department working with [Dr. Bryan Carstens](https://carstenslab.osu.edu/). I am continuing my work on the fig and fig wasp system while also exploring the evolution of ecological communities. As part of my current postdoc position, I have also had the opportunity to teach undergraduate and graduate-level courses, gaining valuable experience as an instructor.
